# Midifungi 🎛️🎹 - A layer-based p5.js framework with live editing and MIDI support

More details will be available soon! For now, check out https://midifungi.netlify.app

# Local Development

- Install dependencies with `npm i`
- Boot things up with: `npm start`

## Overview

- The `midifungi` p5.js framework starts in `/src/midifungi.js`
  - This file gets built into `/dist/midifungi.js`
- The documentation, gallery, and current collab project is built with [Vuepress 2](https://v2.vuepress.vuejs.org/). They are served from `/docs/`, with `README.md` files representing that directory's index.html
- `build-tester.html` is there to quickly test that the library build is working before publishing to NPM and for quick experimentation. Run a local server to view it with `npx http-server`
