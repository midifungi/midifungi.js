# Midifungi 🎛️🎹 - A layer-based p5.js framework with live editing and MIDI support

# Quickstart

- Install dependencies with `npm i`
- Boot things up with: `npm start`

## Overview

- The `midifungi` p5.js framework starts in `/src/midifungi.js`
  - This file gets built into `/dist/midifungi.js`
- The documentation, gallery, and current collab project is built with [Vuepress 2](https://v2.vuepress.vuejs.org/). They are served from `/docs/`, with `README.md` files representing that directory's index.html
- The library comes with a few useful scripts, but they currently need a separate server to run. You can install and run a simple one with `npx http-server` and then viewing one of these files:
- `build-tester.html` is there to quickly test that the library build is working before publishing to NPM (still learning rollup so sometimes it works in Vuepress but not npm)
