      <p>Hello! I'm Oz and Midifungi is an attempt to combine art, performance, and documentation into a single creative expression. I'm still working on the idea but I'm exploring the intersection of "vlogging + devlogging + live coding".</p>
      <p>It's not quite ready yet though, but I'll announce it on <a href="https://twitter.com/midifungi">Twitter @Midifungi</a> sometime by July 2022 👀</p>

  <p><strong>Before exploring Midifungi please note that this project is an artistic creative expression</strong> with my primary audience being other artists, creative technologists, and anyone interested in a fantastical hands-on (and eventually hands-free) live coding experience. Although the project is open source it's not meant to be taken seriously and instead meant to be appreciated as a creative expression.</p>
