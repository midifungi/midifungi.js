::: tip <h1>About</h1>
A dense crowd of people disembarking a train, with trees and clouds in the backdrop. As the train pulls up, a car drives in front of the passengers and obscures them briefly, revealing a new crowd as the train pulls away.

This scene loops with new cars, trains, and passengers with each loop. The scene is represented entirely with emojis. This project was created for the [Weekly Creative Coding Challenge](https://openprocessing.org/curation/78544) in the [Birb's Nest Discord](https://discord.gg/nP2XJBGMeH), under the theme: "Trains"

# Techniques Used

## "Starfield Effect" for passenger placement

[Dan Shiffman](https://shiffman.net/) was doing code reviews for this week's challenge submissions, so I thought it would be fun to incorporate one of his own challenges into the sketch. His first Coding Challenge used a mapping technique that made a field of stars appear as if they were flying past you, and I used that same technique to place the passengers within the crowd:

<Midifungi height=300 title="We're all made of star stuff" :layers="['@2/starfield', '@4/crowd']" />

### Mapping Technique

```js
const sx = map(this.x / this.z, 0, 1, 0, width)
const sy = map(this.y / this.z, 0, 1, 0, height)
const r = map(this.z, 0, width, Layers.starfield.store.size, 0)
ellipse(sx, sy, r, r)
```

### Setting the correct draw order

```js
$emojis.sort((a, b) => b.z - a.z)
```
